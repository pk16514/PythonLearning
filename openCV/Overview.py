Computer Vision

Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and
how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for
Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well
as in photo correction apps.

OpenCV

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing
and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By
using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human.
When it integrated with various libraries, such as Numpuy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV
array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and
perform mathematical operations on these features.

Applications of OpenCV-
    face recognition
    Automated inspection and surveillance
    number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
    Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
    Interactive art installations
    Anamoly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
    Street view image stitching
    Video/image search and retrieval
    Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
    object recognition
    Medical image analysis
    Movies – 3D structure from motion
    TV Channels advertisement recognition

OpenCV Functionality-
    Image/video I/O, processing, display (core, imgproc, highgui)
    Object/feature detection (objdetect, features2d, nonfree)
    Geometry-based monocular or stereo computer vision (calib3d, stitching, videostab)
    Computational photography (photo, video, superres)
    Machine learning & clustering (ml, flann)
    CUDA acceleration (gpu)

Image-Processing

“Image processing is the analysis and manipulation of a digitized image, especially in order to improve
its quality”.

Digital-Image-

An image is nothing more than a two-dimensional matrix (3-D in case of coloured images) which is defined
by the mathematical function f(x, y) at any point is giving the pixel value at that point of an image,
the pixel value describes how bright that pixel is, and what colour it should be. Image processing is
basically signal processing in which input is an image and output is image or characteristics according
to requirement associated with that image.
Image processing basically includes the following three steps:

    Importing the image
    Analysing and manipulating the image
    Output in which result can be altered image or report that is based on image analysis

How Does A Computer Read An Image?

The computer reads any image as a range of values between 0 and 255. For any color image, there are 3
primary channels -red, green and blue.
